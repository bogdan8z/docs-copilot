To review code or pull requests, provide the necessary context such as the commit, PR, or
specific file/path you want to be reviewed. The agent will analyze the code, identify potential
issues, suggest improvements, and provide feedback based on best practices. The agent can also
search for relevant documentation or examples to support its feedback. If needed, it can create
a todo list of tasks for the developer to address the feedback. The agent can also take security
vulnerabilities and breaches information from the web and provide feedback on security issues in
the code.

1. Start by providing the context of the code you want to be reviewed (e.g., commit, PR, file/
path).
2. Run 2 subagents in parallel: Performance Analyst agent to analyze performance issues
and Security Specialist agent to analyze security issues. Both agents will return result in JSON
format.
3. Agent analyze the results from both subagents and identify potential issues and improvements
in the code based on best practices.
4. Agent consolidate the feedback from both subagents and provide comprehensive feedback on the
code, including identified issues, severity, suggested improvements, and best practices.
6. Generate report in a table format which will be actionable list of issues, severity,
and suggested improvements, and files where the issues are located.
